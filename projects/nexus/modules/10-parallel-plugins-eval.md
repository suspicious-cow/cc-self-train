# Module 10 -- Parallel Dev, Plugins & Evaluation

**CC features:** Worktrees, plugins, eval, PermissionRequest hooks, continuous learning

> **Why this step:** Until now, you have worked on one feature at a time. Git worktrees create separate working directories that share the same repository, so you can have two Claude Code instances building two features simultaneously. This is how teams work on multiple features in parallel without merge conflicts blocking progress.

### Step 1: Git Worktrees for Parallel Development

Git worktrees give you multiple working directories for the same repo, enabling two Claude Code instances on different features simultaneously. Create two worktrees:

```
! git worktree add ../nexus-gateway-metrics feature/metrics
! git worktree add ../nexus-gateway-websocket feature/websocket
```

### Step 2: Multiple CC Instances with Shared Tasks

Open two terminals with shared tasks:
- **Terminal 1:** `cd ../nexus-gateway-metrics && CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=nexus-parallel claude`
- **Terminal 2:** `cd ../nexus-gateway-websocket && CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=nexus-parallel claude`

In Terminal 1, describe the metrics feature and ask Claude to create tasks for it:

> "I want to add a metrics system to the gateway. Create tasks for: a request counter per route, a response time histogram, a /metrics endpoint, and tests for metrics collection. Start on the first task."

In Terminal 2, describe the websocket feature:

> "I want to add websocket support to the gateway. Create tasks for: websocket upgrade handling in the router, proxying websocket connections to upstreams, websocket health checks, and tests. Start on the first task."

Both instances share the task list. When one completes a task, the other sees the update. This is the parallel development workflow.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You ran two Claude Code instances simultaneously, each building a different feature in its own worktree, while sharing a task list. This is the most advanced development pattern in Claude Code: parallel autonomous development with coordination. In a real team setting, each worktree could be a different developer's Claude instance, all contributing to the same backlog.

> **Quick check before continuing:**
> - [ ] Two worktrees exist (nexus-gateway-metrics and nexus-gateway-websocket)
> - [ ] Two Claude Code instances are running with `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=nexus-parallel`
> - [ ] Tasks created in one terminal appear in the other
> - [ ] Both instances are making progress on their respective features

### Step 3: Create a Plugin -- "gateway-plugin"

> **Why this step:** Everything you have built -- skills, agents, hooks -- lives inside your project's `.claude/` directory. A plugin packages all of that into a portable bundle that can be shared, versioned, and reused across projects. If you build another gateway next month, you bring the plugin instead of recreating everything from scratch.

Ask Claude to bundle your skills, agents, and hooks into a distributable plugin. Describe what you want packaged.

> "Package all my skills, agents, and hooks into a plugin called gateway-plugin. Create the plugin directory structure with a plugin.json, copy the skills and agents from .claude/, and include the hook configuration. Version 1.0.0."

Claude will create the plugin structure with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, a `skills/` directory, an `agents/` directory, and a `hooks/hooks.json` file.

Test: `claude --plugin-dir ./gateway-plugin`, then try `/gateway-plugin:add-route` and `/gateway-plugin:status-report`. Skills appear with the namespace prefix.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You packaged your skills, agents, and hooks into a distributable plugin. Notice the namespace prefix (`/gateway-plugin:add-route`) -- this prevents naming collisions when multiple plugins are loaded. The plugin is a self-contained directory that anyone can use with `--plugin-dir`. You have gone from "tools that help me" to "tools I can share."

Ready to build an evaluation and scoring system?

### Step 4: Evaluation -- Test Specs and Scoring

> **Why this step:** Evaluation is how you measure Claude's work against objective criteria. Instead of manually checking "does the gateway work?", you define test specs with pass/fail criteria and a scoring system. This pattern is essential for CI/CD pipelines where Claude runs headlessly via `claude -p` and you need automated quality assessment.

Describe the evaluation criteria you want for your gateway and ask Claude to build a scoring script. Think about what matters -- health checks, route matching, rate limiting, caching, middleware, and error handling.

> "Create an evaluation script that scores the gateway out of 10. I want to check: health endpoint responds within 2 seconds, route matching works for at least 5 scenarios, rate limiting returns 429 when exceeded, caching works for GET requests, middleware chain executes in order, and error handling returns proper status codes for upstream failures and bad requests. Run the evaluation and show me the score."

Claude will build the evaluation script and run it. This is a basic evaluation framework. In production, you would use this pattern to score Claude's work against specifications.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You created a scoring rubric for your gateway and ran it as an automated evaluation. This is the foundation for continuous evaluation: every time you make changes, you can re-run the eval to check for regressions. In production workflows, this pattern runs in CI to score Claude's output against specifications before merging.

> **Quick check before continuing:**
> - [ ] The evaluation script runs and reports a score out of 10
> - [ ] The plugin works with `--plugin-dir` and skills have the namespace prefix
> - [ ] Both worktree features are progressing (or completed)

### Step 5: PermissionRequest Hooks

> **Why this step:** PermissionRequest hooks control the permission dialogs Claude shows you. Instead of clicking "allow" every time Claude wants to run tests, you auto-approve known-safe commands. And instead of trusting yourself to remember "do not edit the database directly," you auto-deny dangerous patterns. This is the final layer of automation: even the permission system is programmable.

PermissionRequest hooks fire when Claude would show a permission dialog. Add to `.claude/settings.json`:

- **Auto-approve tests**: matcher `"Bash(npm test*)"` (adjust for your test runner), decision `"behavior": "allow"`
- **Block direct DB edits**: matcher `"Bash(sqlite3 cache.db*)"`, decision `"behavior": "deny"` with message `"Use the cache-agent or cache-inspect skill instead."`

The JSON output format for PermissionRequest hooks uses `hookSpecificOutput.decision.behavior` set to `"allow"` or `"deny"`. Ask Claude to generate the full settings.json entries for your language's test command.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You automated the permission system itself. PermissionRequest hooks are the final piece of the hook lifecycle: SessionStart (context at launch), PreToolUse (guard before actions), PostToolUse (validate after actions), Stop (quality gate at completion), SubagentStop (quality gate for agents), and now PermissionRequest (control the permission dialogs). Every interaction point between you and Claude is now programmable.

Shall we capture what you learned in your project knowledge layer?

### Step 6: Continuous Learning

> **Why this step:** This is not just a cleanup step -- it is the most important habit you will take from this course. Every project improves Claude's effectiveness by capturing what you learned: architecture decisions in CLAUDE.md, coding patterns in rules files, workflows in skills, specialized analysis in agents. The project you just built is not just a gateway -- it is a knowledge base that makes your next project faster.

Update CLAUDE.md with architecture decisions, common commands, known issues, coding conventions, and performance characteristics. Also update `.claude/rules/` with new rules from your work.

The key insight: CLAUDE.md + rules + skills + agents + hooks form a complete "knowledge layer" that makes Claude more effective over time.

## Tips

**Context management is the most important skill.** Use `/compact` aggressively, use subagents to isolate verbose work, and keep CLAUDE.md concise with @imports for details.

**Commit often.** Small, focused commits with `Esc Esc` (rewind) give easy rollback points.

**Use Plan mode before Act mode.** Design in Plan mode first. Thinking up front prevents costly rework.

**Skills encode workflow; subagents encode expertise.** Repeated processes become skills. Specialized perspectives (security, performance) become subagents.

**Hooks eliminate friction.** Any manual step you repeat is a candidate. Start with SessionStart and PostToolUse, then add more as friction points emerge.

**Test through the gateway.** Always test through HTTP, not by calling functions directly. This validates routing, middleware, caching, and rate limiting end-to-end.

**Read the context/ directory.** The cc-self-train repository has detailed CC feature reference docs in `context/`.

## What's Next?

You have built a full-featured local API gateway and mastered every major Claude Code feature. Here are paths forward:

**Extend the gateway:** WebSocket proxying, gRPC support, circuit breaker patterns, distributed rate limiting, request/response transformation middleware, OpenAPI spec generation from route configs.

**Go deeper with Claude Code:** Explore the `context/` directory in cc-self-train for advanced patterns. Build your own MCP server. Create and distribute plugins. Set up CI/CD pipelines using `claude -p` (headless mode).

**Try another project:** [Forge](../forge/) if you want to build a personal dev toolkit, or [Sentinel](../sentinel/) if you want to build a code analyzer and test generator. Both cover the same CC features through different domains.
