# Module 1 -- Setup & First Contact

**CC features:** CLAUDE.md, /init, /memory, interactive mode, keyboard shortcuts

> **Persona — Guide:** Explain everything, define terms, celebrate small wins. "Let's try…", "Here's what that does…"

> **Used `/start`?** Module 1 was completed during onboarding. Jump to [Module 2 -- Blueprint & Build](02-blueprint.md).

### Step 1: Create Your Project

Open a terminal in the cc-self-train directory and create the project under `workspace/`:

```
mkdir -p workspace/nexus-gateway
cd workspace/nexus-gateway
git init
```

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code

```
claude
```

You are now in an interactive Claude Code session. This is your primary interface for the entire project.

### Step 3: Run /init

Type the following into Claude Code:

```
/init
```

Claude will scan your directory and generate a `CLAUDE.md` file. Since the directory is mostly empty, the file will be minimal. That is fine -- you will build it up throughout the project.

### Step 4: Tour of CLAUDE.md

Ask Claude: `Read CLAUDE.md and explain what each section does and why it matters`

CLAUDE.md is Claude's persistent memory for your project. It loads automatically every session and can contain build commands, architecture notes, coding conventions, and workflow preferences.

### Step 5: Keyboard Shortcuts

Practice each shortcut in the table below. Do not skip this -- muscle memory with these shortcuts saves significant time across the remaining 9 modules.

| Shortcut | What It Does | Try It Now |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `Tab` | Accept a suggestion or autocomplete | Type a partial file path and press Tab |
| `Shift+Tab` | Toggle between Plan mode and Act mode | Press it twice to cycle back |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current generation or clear input | Start a long prompt, then cancel |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear terminal screen (keeps history) | Clear the screen, then scroll up |
| `@` | File path autocomplete | Type `@CLAUDE` and see the suggestion |
| `!` | Bash mode -- run a shell command directly | Type `! git status` |
| `Shift+Enter` or `\` + `Enter` | Multiline input | Type a two-line message |
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind conversation/code to a previous state | Press Escape twice |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggle verbose output | See detailed tool usage |
| `Ctrl+R` | Reverse search command history | Search through previous inputs |

### Step 6: Explore /memory

Type `/memory` to open CLAUDE.md in your system editor. Add a project overview, placeholder commands (start server, run tests, check health), and an architecture section to be filled in Module 2. Save and close -- Claude now has this context in every future session.

### Step 7: Exercise

Ask Claude: `Explain what CLAUDE.md is, where it lives in the hierarchy, and how it differs from .claude/rules/ files. Show the memory hierarchy from most to least specific.`

Verify Claude explains: CLAUDE.md (project) > CLAUDE.local.md (local/personal) > ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (user-global), plus .claude/rules/ for modular, path-scoped rules.

### Leaving and Coming Back

You can exit Claude Code at any time with `Ctrl+D` or `/exit`. To pick up where you left off:

- **`claude -c`** — continues your most recent session in this directory. This is the fastest way to resume.
- **`/resume`** — opens a session picker so you can choose which session to continue. Use this if you have multiple sessions.
- **`/rename my-session-name`** — names your current session before you leave, so you can find it easily with `/resume` later.

Your CLAUDE.md, rules, and project files persist between sessions. Conversation history is restored when you resume, but you may need to re-approve permission prompts.

> **Tip:** Before exiting a long session, run `/memory` to save any important context. Claude reads CLAUDE.md at the start of every session, so anything saved there carries forward automatically.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] `workspace/nexus-gateway/` directory exists with `git init` completed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists with project overview content
- [ ] You ran `/init` successfully
- [ ] You can use `Shift+Tab` to toggle plan mode
- [ ] You tried all 10 keyboard shortcuts from the table
- [ ] You opened `/memory` and edited CLAUDE.md
- [ ] You know how to exit (`Ctrl+D`) and resume (`claude -c`) a session
- [ ] You can explain the memory hierarchy
