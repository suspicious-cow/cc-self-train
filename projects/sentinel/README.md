# Sentinel -- Code Analyzer & Test Generator

A hands-on project for learning Claude Code by building a real tool. You will construct a code analysis engine that scans source files for issues, generates tests, tracks coverage, and produces quality reports. Along the way, you will use every major Claude Code feature -- from CLAUDE.md and plan mode through subagents, tasks, plugins, and evaluation.

**Level:** Intermediate-Advanced
**Time:** 3-5 sessions (8-15 hours)
**Prerequisites:** Comfortable with at least one programming language, familiar with git basics. Prior Claude Code experience (e.g., Projects 1-3 from this curriculum) is helpful but not required.

## What You Will Build

Sentinel is a **code quality meta-tool** -- a tool that improves other code. When finished, it will:

- Recursively scan source files in any project directory
- Apply configurable analysis rules (complexity, naming, missing docs, unused imports)
- Report issues with severity, file location, and actionable messages
- Generate test cases for source files that lack coverage
- Track coverage over time and store historical data in SQLite
- Output reports in text, JSON, and HTML formats
- Expose all functionality through a CLI: `sentinel scan`, `sentinel rules`, `sentinel report`, `sentinel coverage`

## What You'll Build — Milestones

Here's what your project looks like at key milestones:

### After Module 3 — Code Scanner

A CLI that recursively scans source files and reports issues — complexity warnings, naming violations, missing docs. `sentinel scan` and `sentinel rules list` work from your terminal.

```
sentinel/
├── src/
│   ├── main.*              # CLI entry point
│   ├── scanner.*           # File discovery and parsing
│   ├── rules/              # Configurable analysis rules
│   │   ├── complexity.*
│   │   ├── naming.*
│   │   └── docs.*
│   └── reporter.*          # Text/JSON output
├── .claude/rules/          # Your conventions
├── CLAUDE.md
└── CLAUDE.local.md
```

### After Module 6 — Test Generator and Coverage Tracker

Generates test stubs for uncovered files, tracks coverage over time in SQLite, and produces HTML quality reports. MCP integration lets Claude query your project's health.

```
sentinel/
├── src/
│   ├── generator.*         # Test stub generation
│   ├── coverage.*          # Coverage tracking
│   ├── reporter.*          # Text, JSON, and HTML reports
│   └── ...
├── data/
│   └── coverage.db         # Historical coverage data
├── .claude/
│   ├── skills/             # Custom commands
│   ├── settings.json       # Automation hooks
│   └── rules/
└── .mcp.json               # MCP server config
```

### After Module 10 — Full Quality Platform

A comprehensive code quality tool with custom rule authoring, cross-project analysis, trend dashboards, and CI integration. Subagents run parallel analyses, tasks track quality improvements, and a publishable plugin shares your rules with the community.

## Set Up Your Dev Environment

Before starting Module 1, make sure your language toolchain is ready. Sentinel works in **any language** -- pick whichever you are most comfortable with.

| Language | Requirements | Quick check |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Python** | Python 3.10+, pip/conda/uv | `python --version` |
| **TypeScript** | Node.js 18+, npm/pnpm/yarn | `node --version` |
| **Go** | Go 1.21+ | `go version` |
| **Rust** | Rust 1.70+ via rustup | `rustc --version` |
| **Docker** | Optional -- any project works in a container | `docker --version` |

Install links: [Python](https://python.org) | [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) | [Rust](https://rustup.rs)

### Environment Isolation

**Environment isolation:** If you chose an environment during `/start` (venv, conda, or Docker), it's already set up in your project directory. If you skipped it and want to add one later, ask Claude: "Help me set up [venv/conda/Docker] for this project."

### Git

```
git --version
```

If missing: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Coverage tools (needed in Module 9)

| Language | Coverage Tool |
|----------|--------------|
| Python | `coverage` or `pytest-cov` |
| TypeScript | `c8`, `istanbul`, or built-in via `vitest --coverage` |
| Go | Built-in: `go test -cover` |
| Rust | `cargo-tarpaulin` or `cargo-llvm-cov` |

### Claude Code

```
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --version
```

You need an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) or a Max subscription.

## Tips

- **Context is your most valuable resource.** Use `/compact` aggressively, use subagents for verbose operations, and keep CLAUDE.md focused.
- **Start with plan mode.** Press Shift+Tab before implementing non-trivial features. Think before you build.
- **Test early, test often.** The build-test-fix-commit cycle gives Claude concrete feedback. Always run tests before committing.
- **Use subagents for exploration.** Delegate searches and analysis to subagents to keep your main conversation clean.
- **Name your sessions.** Use `/rename sentinel-coverage-work` for easy `/resume` later.
- **Hooks time out at 60 seconds** by default. Set a custom `timeout` in hook config if you need more.
- **MCP tool names** follow the pattern `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. Use this in hook matchers.
- **Worktrees share git history.** Changes committed in one worktree are visible in all others.

## What's Next?

You have now used every major Claude Code feature. Here are paths forward:

**Extend Sentinel.** Add support for more languages, more rules, a web dashboard, CI integration, or GitHub PR comments via MCP.

**Try another project:** [Forge](../forge/) if you want to build a personal dev toolkit, or [Nexus](../nexus/) if you want to build a local API gateway. Both cover the same CC features through different domains.

**Build your own tools.** Take the patterns you learned -- skills, subagents, hooks, MCP, tasks -- and apply them to your real projects. Start with a CLAUDE.md and a few rules, then add skills and hooks as your workflow matures.

**Share your plugin.** If your quality-tools plugin is useful, publish it for others. Create a marketplace or share the directory. See `context/plugins.txt` for distribution details.

**Contribute back.** If you found bugs, had ideas for improvements, or wrote useful patterns during this project, contribute them to the cc-self-train repository. Open an issue or PR.
