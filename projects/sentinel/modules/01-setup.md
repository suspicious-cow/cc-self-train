# Module 1 -- Setup & First Contact

**CC features:** CLAUDE.md, /init, /memory, interactive mode, keyboard shortcuts

> **Used `/start`?** Module 1 was completed during onboarding. Jump to [Module 2 -- Blueprint & Build](02-blueprint.md).

In this module you create the sentinel project, initialize it with Claude Code, and learn the fundamentals of interactive mode.

### Step 1: Create your project directory

Create the project directory inside cc-self-train under `workspace/`:

```
mkdir -p workspace/sentinel
cd workspace/sentinel
git init
```

### Step 2: Launch Claude Code

```
claude
```

Claude starts in interactive mode. You are now inside the Claude Code REPL.

### Step 3: Run /init

Type this inside Claude Code:

```
/init
```

Claude will scan your (empty) project and generate a `CLAUDE.md` file. Since the project is new, the file will be minimal. That is fine -- you will build it up.

### Step 4: Tour of CLAUDE.md

Open the generated CLAUDE.md and read it. This file is Claude's persistent memory for your project. Everything you put here, Claude reads at the start of every session.

Ask Claude to explain what CLAUDE.md does:

```
What is CLAUDE.md and how does Claude Code use it? Explain the memory hierarchy.
```

Claude should explain the four memory levels: managed policy, project memory (CLAUDE.md), project rules (.claude/rules/), user memory (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md), and local project memory (CLAUDE.local.md).

### Step 5: Keyboard shortcuts

Try each of these shortcuts now. Do not skip this -- muscle memory matters.

| Shortcut | What it does | Try it now |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `Tab` | Accept Claude's suggestion or autocomplete | Type a partial word and press Tab |
| `Shift+Tab` | Toggle between normal mode, plan mode, and auto-accept mode | Press it twice to cycle through modes |
| `Ctrl+C` | Cancel current generation or input | Press while Claude is responding |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear terminal screen (keeps conversation) | Press it -- notice history is preserved |
| `@` | File path mention / autocomplete | Type `@` and start typing a filename |
| `!` | Bash mode -- run a shell command directly | Type `! git status` |
| `Shift+Enter` or `\` + `Enter` | Multiline input | Start a multi-line prompt |
| `Esc Esc` | Rewind conversation/code to a previous point | Double-tap Escape |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggle verbose output | Shows detailed tool usage |
| `Ctrl+R` | Reverse search through command history | Search your previous prompts |

### Step 6: Explore /memory

Type this in Claude Code:

```
/memory
```

This opens your CLAUDE.md in your system editor. Add these lines:

```
# Sentinel Project

## About
Code analyzer and test generator CLI tool.

## Commands
- Build: (fill in when you have a build command)
- Test: (fill in when you have a test command)
- Lint: (fill in when you have a lint command)
```

Save and close the editor. Claude now has this context for every future session.

### Step 7: First conversation

Ask Claude something about your project plan:

```
I am building a code analyzer called Sentinel. It will scan source files for
quality issues, generate tests, and track coverage. What would be a good
high-level architecture for this kind of tool?
```

Read the response. You do not need to act on it yet -- Module 2 is where you plan and build.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] `workspace/sentinel/` directory exists with `git init` completed
- [ ] CLAUDE.md exists (generated by /init, then edited via /memory)
- [ ] You tried all keyboard shortcuts from the table above
- [ ] You successfully ran `/memory` and edited CLAUDE.md
- [ ] You had at least one conversation with Claude about the project
