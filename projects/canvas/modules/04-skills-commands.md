# Module 4 -- Skills and Commands

**CC features:** SKILL.md, frontmatter, custom slash commands, hot-reload,
argument substitution, `disable-model-invocation`

### 4.1 Create the Skills Directory

> **Why this step:** Skills are reusable, parameterized workflows you invoke with a slash command. Instead of typing the same multi-step prompt every time you need a new page, you write it once as a skill and invoke it with `/new-page faq`. Skills are the difference between using Claude Code casually and using it like a power tool.

```
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/new-page
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/component
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/check-site
```

### 4.2 Create the "new-page" Skill

Describe the skill you want to Claude. You want a skill that scaffolds a new HTML page with your site's shared layout -- so every time you invoke `/new-page faq`, it reads your existing nav and footer, creates a new page with the right boilerplate, and reminds you to update links.

> "Create a 'new-page' skill in .claude/skills/new-page/SKILL.md. It should take a page name as an argument (using $0), read index.html to get the shared nav and footer, then create a new HTML file with the full boilerplate and shared layout. Also create a page-template.md reference file showing the expected structure. Set allowed-tools to Read, Write, Edit, and Bash."

Claude will ask you clarifying questions about the template structure or what the skill should do after creating the file. Answer based on how you want your pages to work.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You created a skill with a supporting file. The `SKILL.md` is the instruction template -- it tells Claude what to do when you invoke `/new-page`. The `page-template.md` is a reference document the skill can read for the HTML boilerplate. This pattern (instruction + reference files) is how you build skills that produce consistent, high-quality output every time.

Ready to build the component skill?

### 4.3 Create the "component" Skill

Now create a skill for generating reusable CSS components. This one should take a component type as an argument (like "card", "button", "hero") and create the CSS following your design system.

> "Create a 'component' skill that takes a component type as $0, reads the existing CSS to understand our design tokens, then creates a new BEM-style CSS class with responsive styles and hover/focus states. Also create a component-templates.md reference with example HTML and CSS for common component types."

Discuss with Claude what component types you want supported and how the CSS should be organized -- appended to the main file or in separate component files.

> **Quick check before continuing:**
> - [ ] `.claude/skills/new-page/SKILL.md` exists with frontmatter and a supporting template file
> - [ ] `.claude/skills/component/SKILL.md` exists with a component templates reference
> - [ ] Both skills use `$0` for argument substitution

### 4.4 Create the "check-site" Skill

This skill is different -- it validates your site without modifying anything. Describe the quality checks you want to Claude:

> "Create a 'check-site' skill that scans all HTML pages and checks for common issues -- missing doctype, missing lang attribute, missing meta tags, heading hierarchy problems, images without alt text, broken internal links, missing title elements. Output a pass/fail report. Set disable-model-invocation to true so it only runs when I explicitly invoke it, and limit allowed-tools to Read, Bash, Grep, and Glob."

Notice `disable-model-invocation: true` -- this skill can only be triggered
by you typing `/check-site`. Claude will not invoke it automatically.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You created three skills with different purposes: `new-page` generates files, `component` creates CSS, and `check-site` validates without modifying anything. The `disable-model-invocation: true` flag on `check-site` is important -- it means Claude will never run this validation on its own, only when you explicitly ask. You will use this flag whenever a skill should be user-triggered only (like destructive operations or expensive checks).

Want to test all three skills in action?

### 4.5 Test Your Skills

Test each skill:

```
/new-page faq
/component card
/check-site
```

Try with different arguments:

```
/new-page resume
/component hero
```

### 4.6 Argument Substitution

Skills support these substitution variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed after the skill name |
| `$ARGUMENTS[0]` or `$0` | First argument |
| `$ARGUMENTS[1]` or `$1` | Second argument |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or `$N` | Nth argument (zero-indexed) |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID |

### 4.7 Hot-Reload

> **Why this step:** Hot-reload means you can iterate on your skills without restarting Claude Code. This makes skill development fast -- edit, save, test, repeat. No restart cycle.

With Claude Code still running, open `.claude/skills/check-site/SKILL.md` in a
separate editor and add a line to the checks:

```
8. All <a> tags with external URLs have target="_blank" and rel="noopener"
```

Save the file. Now invoke `/check-site` again in Claude Code. The updated skill
content takes effect immediately -- no restart needed.

### 4.8 Create a Manual-Only Skill

Create one more skill -- a page brief template that outputs a planning document for a new page without Claude processing it.

> "Create a 'page-brief' skill with disable-model-invocation set to true. It should take a page name as $0 and output a planning template with fields like purpose, target audience, key sections, SEO keywords, and design notes."

Test it: `/page-brief "Services"`

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You now have four custom skills that extend Claude Code's capabilities specifically for your portfolio project. The `new-page` and `component` skills are productivity multipliers -- what used to be a multi-paragraph prompt is now a single slash command. The `check-site` skill is a quality gate. The `page-brief` skill outputs raw text without Claude processing it (because of `disable-model-invocation`). Together, these skills form a custom toolkit tailored to your project.

### Checkpoint

- [ ] `.claude/skills/new-page/SKILL.md` exists with frontmatter and supporting files
- [ ] `.claude/skills/component/SKILL.md` exists with component templates
- [ ] `.claude/skills/check-site/SKILL.md` exists with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- [ ] All three skills invoke correctly with `/skill-name`
- [ ] Argument substitution works (`$0`, `$ARGUMENTS`)
- [ ] Hot-reload works: edit SKILL.md while Claude runs, changes take effect
- [ ] Page brief skill outputs raw text without Claude processing
