# Module 2 -- Blueprint and Build

**CC features:** Plan mode, git integration, basic prompting

> **Persona — Guide:** Explain everything, define terms, celebrate small wins. "Let's try…", "Here's what that does…"

### 2.1 Enter Plan Mode

> **Why this step:** Plan mode is one of Claude Code's most important features. It lets you think through architecture *with* Claude before any code gets written. This prevents the "just start coding" trap that leads to messy rewrites later.

Press `Shift+Tab` to switch to plan mode. You will see the mode indicator
change. In plan mode, Claude analyzes and plans without making changes. This
is where you design before you build.

Alternatively, type:

```
/plan
```

### 2.2 Design the Architecture

Now describe your portfolio site to Claude. Tell it what pages you want -- home, about, projects, blog, contact -- and what each page should include. Don't worry about getting the prompt perfect. Just describe your vision and let Claude ask clarifying questions.

Something like:

> "I want to build a personal portfolio site with about five pages. Help me plan the architecture -- what pages should I have, what goes on each one, and how should the CSS and file structure work? Don't write any code yet, just the plan."

Claude will probably ask about your design preferences, layout style, and what kind of content you want to feature. Answer naturally -- these choices are yours. The back-and-forth is the point: you are designing *with* Claude, not dictating to it.

Once Claude produces a plan, read it carefully.

### 2.3 Review and Iterate

Still in plan mode, push back on the plan. Ask about the trade-offs Claude made. Challenge the decisions you are unsure about. For example:

> "Why did you choose that approach for the CSS? What are the trade-offs? And how should the navigation highlight the current page?"

Claude does not get defensive about its plans -- ask hard questions and it will revise. If something does not feel right, say so. Refine the plan until you are satisfied with the architecture.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You used plan mode to design your entire site architecture before writing a single line of code. This is a pattern you will use constantly: plan first, then build. The back-and-forth questioning in step 2.3 is how you pressure-test a design. Claude does not get defensive about its plans -- ask hard questions and it will revise.

### 2.4 Exit Plan Mode and Execute

Press `Shift+Tab` to return to normal mode. Now tell Claude to start building -- but scope it down. You do not want all five pages at once. Ask for just the foundation:

> "Let's start building from the plan. Create the shared navigation, footer, the home page with its hero section, and the CSS design system. Don't build the other pages yet -- just the home page and shared components."

Constraining scope is a key prompting skill -- it keeps Claude focused and prevents runaway file creation. Let Claude create the files, then open `index.html` in your browser to check it.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You went from plan mode to normal mode and gave Claude a focused, scoped instruction. Notice that you told Claude what to build *and* what NOT to build yet ("Do NOT build the other pages yet"). Constraining scope is a key prompting skill -- it keeps Claude focused and prevents runaway file creation.

> **Quick check before continuing:**
> - [ ] Your site plan covers all 5 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact)
> - [ ] Claude created the shared nav, footer, home page, and CSS design system
> - [ ] You opened `index.html` in your browser and it renders correctly
> - [ ] You are back in normal mode (check the mode indicator)

### 2.5 Create a Feature Branch

> **Why this step:** Feature branches keep your experiments separate from working code. If something goes wrong, you can throw away the branch without affecting main. This is also how real teams work -- every feature gets its own branch.

```
! git checkout -b feature/core-pages
```

### 2.6 Build the About Page

Ask Claude to build your About page. Describe what sections you want -- a bio, your skills, your experience or education timeline. Tell Claude about yourself (or use placeholder content for now). Something like:

> "Create the about page with my bio, a skills section grouped by category, and a timeline of my experience. Use the shared nav and footer and the CSS design system we already have."

If the result does not match what you imagined, tell Claude what to change. This is a conversation, not a one-shot.

### 2.7 Build the Projects Page

Now ask Claude for the projects page. Describe the layout you want -- a card grid with your projects (or placeholders). Tell Claude how you want the cards to look and how many columns at different screen sizes:

> "Build a projects page with a responsive card grid. Each card should have a title, description, technology tags, and a link. Make it responsive -- one column on mobile, more on larger screens."

Open each page in your browser. Test the navigation links between pages.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You gave Claude two separate, focused prompts to build two pages. Notice the pattern: each prompt specified the page structure, the content sections, and the CSS approach. The more specific your prompt, the closer the result matches what you want. You also tested in the browser after each page -- always verify Claude's output visually.

### 2.8 Manual Testing

Test your site by opening each page in the browser. Click through the navigation, resize the window to check responsiveness, and look for anything that seems off. If you find issues -- broken links, layout problems, pages that look wrong on mobile -- tell Claude what you see and ask it to fix them.

### 2.9 Commit and Merge

> **Why this step:** Committing through Claude Code (using `!` prefix for shell commands) keeps everything in one place. You do not need to switch terminals. The merge back to main means your feature branch work is now part of your stable codebase.

```
! git add -A
! git commit -m "feat: home, about, and projects pages with CSS design system"
! git checkout main
! git merge feature/core-pages
```

### Checkpoint

- [ ] You used plan mode to design the architecture before writing code
- [ ] CSS design system exists with custom properties for colors, fonts, spacing
- [ ] Home page has a hero section, intro, and navigation
- [ ] About page has bio, skills, and timeline sections
- [ ] Projects page has a responsive card grid
- [ ] Navigation works between all pages
- [ ] Layout is responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Changes are committed and merged to main
