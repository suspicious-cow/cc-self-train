# Module 4 -- Skills and Commands

**CC features:** SKILL.md, frontmatter, custom slash commands, hot-reload,
argument substitution, `disable-model-invocation`

> **Persona — Collaborator:** Ask before telling, give pointers not answers. "What do you think…", "Try this and tell me…"

## 4.1 Create the Skills Directory

> **Why this step:** Skills are reusable, parameterized workflows you trigger with slash commands. Instead of retyping a complex prompt every time you want to add an item or search your knowledge base, you write it once as a skill and invoke it with `/add-item` or `/search`. Think of skills as saved prompts with superpowers -- they accept arguments, restrict tool access, and can reference supporting files.

```
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/add-item
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/search
! mkdir -p .claude/skills/daily-summary
```

## 4.2 Create the "add-item" Skill

Describe to Claude what your add-item skill should do. You want a slash command that takes an item type and details, validates the input, runs the forge add command, and shows the result. Tell Claude about your validation rules -- what makes a valid note vs. a valid snippet vs. a valid bookmark.

> "Create an add-item skill in .claude/skills/add-item/SKILL.md. It should accept the item type as the first argument and details as additional arguments. It needs to validate inputs -- non-empty titles, valid URLs for bookmarks, lowercase tags, uppercase template variables -- before running forge add. Also create a validation-rules.md companion file that spells out what's valid for each data type. Restrict it to Read, Write, Bash, and Edit tools."

Claude may ask about edge cases in your validation rules. Answer based on what makes sense for your workflow -- these are your conventions.

## 4.3 Create the "search" Skill

Now create a search skill. Describe how you want search to work -- query parsing with special prefixes like `tag:` and `type:`, full-text search as the default, results displayed as a clean table, and helpful suggestions when nothing matches.

> "Create a search skill in .claude/skills/search/SKILL.md. It should take the search query from $ARGUMENTS, support prefixes like tag:, type:, and since: for filtering, fall back to full-text search, display results as a table with ID, type, title, tags, and date, and suggest alternatives if nothing matches. Restrict tools to Read, Bash, Grep, and Glob."

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You created two skills with different specialties: one for data entry with validation, one for intelligent search with query parsing. Each skill has its own SKILL.md with frontmatter that controls its name, description, and which tools it can use. The `allowed-tools` field is important -- it restricts what Claude can do when running the skill, which prevents unexpected side effects. You will use this pattern whenever you want a repeatable, constrained workflow.

Shall we create a manual-only skill next?

## 4.4 Create the "daily-summary" Skill

Create a daily summary skill that shows what you added to forge today. This one should be manual-only -- you do not want Claude invoking it automatically during other tasks.

> "Create a daily-summary skill that lists everything I added or modified today, grouped by type, with title, tags, and a brief summary for each item. Set disable-model-invocation to true so it only runs when I type /daily-summary. Restrict tools to Read and Bash."

Notice `disable-model-invocation: true` -- this skill can only be triggered
by you typing `/daily-summary`. Claude will not invoke it automatically.

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You created a skill with `disable-model-invocation: true`. This is a critical distinction: most skills can be triggered both by you (typing `/daily-summary`) and by Claude (when it decides the skill is relevant). Setting `disable-model-invocation: true` means *only you* can trigger it. Use this for skills that should never run automatically -- summaries, reports, destructive operations, anything where you want explicit human intent.

> **Quick check before continuing:**
> - [ ] Three skill directories exist under `.claude/skills/`
> - [ ] Each has a `SKILL.md` with frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools)
> - [ ] The daily-summary skill has `disable-model-invocation: true`

## 4.5 Test Your Skills

Test each skill:

```
/add-item note
/search testing
/daily-summary
```

Try with arguments:

```
/add-item snippet python
/search tag:reference
```

## 4.6 Argument Substitution

Skills support these substitution variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS` | All arguments passed after the skill name |
| `$ARGUMENTS[0]` or `$0` | First argument |
| `$ARGUMENTS[1]` or `$1` | Second argument |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]` or `$N` | Nth argument (zero-indexed) |
| `${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID}` | Current session ID |

## 4.7 Hot-Reload

> **Why this step:** Skills hot-reload means you can iterate on a skill's behavior without restarting Claude Code. Edit the SKILL.md file, save it, and the next invocation uses the updated version. This makes skill development fast and interactive.

With Claude Code still running, open `.claude/skills/search/SKILL.md` in a
separate editor and add a line to the steps:

```
7. After displaying results, show the total search time
```

Save the file. Now invoke `/search` again in Claude Code. The updated skill
content takes effect immediately -- no restart needed.

## 4.8 Create a Manual-Only Skill

Create one more manual-only skill -- a bug report template generator. Tell Claude what fields you want in the template (type, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, version) and that the issue title should come from the first argument.

> "Create an issue-template skill with disable-model-invocation: true. It should take an issue title as $0 and output a bug report template with fields for Type, Steps to reproduce, Expected behavior, Actual behavior, and Forge version."

Test it: `/issue-template "Search returns wrong results"`

> **STOP -- What you just did:** You now have a library of custom slash commands tailored to your forge toolkit. Skills are one of the most practical Claude Code features -- they turn multi-step workflows into one-line commands. The combination of argument substitution (`$0`, `$ARGUMENTS`), tool restrictions (`allowed-tools`), and invocation control (`disable-model-invocation`) gives you fine-grained control over what each skill does and when it runs.

## Checkpoint

- [ ] `.claude/skills/add-item/SKILL.md` exists with frontmatter and supporting files
- [ ] `.claude/skills/search/SKILL.md` exists with argument parsing
- [ ] `.claude/skills/daily-summary/SKILL.md` exists with `disable-model-invocation: true`
- [ ] All three skills invoke correctly with `/skill-name`
- [ ] Argument substitution works (`$0`, `$ARGUMENTS`)
- [ ] Hot-reload works: edit SKILL.md while Claude runs, changes take effect
- [ ] Issue template skill outputs raw text without Claude processing
