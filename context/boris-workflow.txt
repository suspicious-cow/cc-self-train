4/ Our team shares a single http://CLAUDE.md for the Claude Code repo. We check it into git, and the whole team contributes multiple times a week. Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the http://CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next

5/ During code review, I will often tag @.claude on my coworkers' PRs to add something to the http://CLAUDE.md as part of the PR. We use the Claude Code Github action (/install-github-action) for this. It's our version of

6/ Most sessions start in Plan mode (shift+tab twice). If my goal is to write a Pull Request, I will use Plan mode, and go back and forth with Claude until I like its plan. From there, I switch into auto-accept edits mode and Claude can usually 1-shot it. A good plan is really
