it's time to teach me all about claude code. look in the context folder for a lot of information. I want to eventually have a repo like the one mentioned in the affaanmustafa-short-and-long-guides.txt file. come up with a         plan to teach me everything about claude code as we build a project. I want to be totally hands on with your guidance as you teach me. Ultimately I want to end with everything that is possible and shown in the repo             
  mentioned. Let's make the app a python app, use conda to create an environment, do everything from claude.md all the way to the end with everything in between. I want to do a deep dive on everything so i fully understand it     
   before we move on. it will be a long journey so I need you to plan carefully and make careful notes that we will update as we go along so we can persist the training across claude sessions or so we can go back if we have       
  to, etc. Ask me any clarifying questions now or along the way as needed.
