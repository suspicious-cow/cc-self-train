# Learn Claude Code by Doing

A hands-on, project-based curriculum for mastering [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). You pick a project, pick your language, and learn every major CC feature by building something real.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code (if you haven't already)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/suspicious-cow/cc-self-train.git
cd cc-self-train

# 3. Launch Claude Code
claude

# 4. When prompted to trust project hooks, approve them
#    (they show a welcome banner and check GitHub for
#     CC updates, nothing else — /hooks to review if curious)

# 5. Type this when Claude starts:
/start
```

That's it. Claude will walk you through picking a project, checking your dev environment, and scaffolding everything. You'll need an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/) or a Max subscription.

> **What are those hooks?** This repo includes two small SessionStart hooks. The first shows the welcome banner above. The second pings GitHub to check if a newer version of Claude Code is available — if so, it tells you to run `claude update`. Both are read-only, open source, and visible in `.claude/scripts/`.

## Who This Is For

You've installed Claude Code and maybe run `/init`. Now what? Pick one of 4 projects and work through 10 progressive modules that take you from "first session" to "multi-agent orchestration." Every project teaches every CC feature — you choose based on what you want to build.

**No specific language required.** Forge, Nexus, and Sentinel describe *what* to build, not *how*. You choose Python, TypeScript, Go, Rust, or whatever you're comfortable with. Canvas uses plain HTML/CSS/JS — no build tools needed.

## Manual Setup (if you prefer)

### Install Claude Code

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude --version
```

### Set Up Your Dev Environment

Make sure your language toolchain is ready:

| Language | What you need | Quick check |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Python** | Python 3.10+, a package manager (conda, venv, uv, or pip) | `python --version` |
| **TypeScript/Node** | Node.js 18+, npm/pnpm/yarn | `node --version` |
| **Go** | Go 1.21+ | `go version` |
| **Rust** | Rust via rustup, cargo | `rustc --version` |
| **Other** | Whatever your language needs — Claude can help you set it up | |

**Docker users:** Any project can be done inside a container. Bring your own Dockerfile or ask Claude to generate one for your language.

### Install Git

```bash
git --version
```

If you don't have it: [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Pick a Project and Go

Each project covers all 10 modules. Pick based on what sounds fun to build.

## The 4 Projects

### [Canvas — Personal Portfolio Site](projects/canvas/README.md) ⭐ Recommended for first-timers

Build a multi-page portfolio site with responsive design, a blog, and a contact form using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Why this project?** Every developer needs a portfolio site but never gets around to building one. Canvas uses zero build tools — no npm, no frameworks, no compilers. Just open `index.html` in your browser. That means you spend 100% of your time learning Claude Code instead of fighting your toolchain. You'll walk away with a real, deployable site *and* mastery of every CC feature.

**Best for:** First-timers, anyone who wants the fastest path to learning CC

---

### [Forge — Personal Dev Toolkit](projects/forge/README.md)

Build a command-line tool (a program you run from your terminal) for notes, snippets, bookmarks, and templates that grows into a searchable, pluggable knowledge base with API.

**Why this project?** Most tutorials build throwaway apps you'll never open again. Forge builds something you'll actually use every day — a personal tool that organizes your dev life. Notes from meetings, code snippets you keep re-Googling, project templates you set up the same way every time. By the end, you'll have a tool that saves you time *and* deep expertise in Claude Code.

**Best for:** Tool builders, "I want something I'll actually use after this course"

---

### [Nexus — Local API Gateway](projects/nexus/README.md)

Build a local server that sits between apps and manages their traffic — routing requests, limiting how fast clients can call, caching responses, and checking if services are healthy.

**Why this project?** Every production system has a gateway that manages traffic between services, but most developers treat it as a black box. By building one from scratch — routing, rate limiting, caching, health checks — you'll understand how services actually talk to each other at a level most developers never reach. If you've ever wondered what sits between a user's request and the server that handles it, this is your chance to find out by building it yourself.

**Best for:** Backend devs, anyone curious about infrastructure and how services connect

---

### [Sentinel — Code Analyzer & Test Generator](projects/sentinel/README.md)

Build a tool that scans code for problems, generates tests automatically, and tracks how well-tested your code is — growing into a full quality dashboard.

**Why this project?** Sentinel is a tool that makes your *other* code better. It finds bugs before they ship, writes tests so you don't have to start from scratch, and tracks quality over time. If you care about code quality, this project teaches you how to enforce it automatically. It's the "meta-tool" — a program that improves every other program you write.

**Best for:** Quality-focused devs, "I want to build a tool that levels up everything else I write"

---

All four projects are **local-only** and **genuinely useful**. Canvas uses HTML/CSS/JS (no setup needed); Forge, Nexus, and Sentinel are **language-agnostic** — you choose. They all teach the same CC features through the same 10 modules — pick based on interest, not difficulty.

## The 10 Modules

Every project follows this same progression:

| # | Module | CC Features Taught |

## Design Principles

- **Language-agnostic:** Every project works in any language. You choose.
- **Local-only:** No cloud services required (MCP connections are optional/local).
- **Same curriculum, different domains:** All 3 projects teach the same features in the same order. Pick based on interest.
- **Hands-on:** You learn by building, not by reading. Every module ends with verification.
- **Real tools:** Every project produces something genuinely useful, not a toy.
